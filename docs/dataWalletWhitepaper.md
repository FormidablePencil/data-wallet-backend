# Data wallet whitepaper

Some terms should be changed in web3:

User aquisition to individual usings of whatever feature they're using.
Users to individuals.

The solution web3 bring with it it's own set of problems. 
1. With a diversification of features requires users to keep track of their who is using what data and where. Thus, Data Wallet. A central control in the hands of the individual bring even more possibilities of more advanced control features of one's own data like composibility and reusability. However, so long as it doesn't compromise the user, so achieving this map of where what data is where only user has access to this map data is paramount or else better to entrust someone to keep it safe like Facebook does, however the trust isn't verifiable. So there is no trust but hope that they use it the way you hope they do.

#### The problems aims to solve and the features aims to bring.

1. True ownership of personal data.
2. Achieve central control of data.
3. Difficulty to trace and track your data.
4. Composablity and reusability; edit once updating everywhere.

Go in depth on each wholistically.

#### What does Data Wallet mean for individuals

- Easily keep track of their data when in a dynamic and rich ecosystem Web3 will be.
- Similarly as difficult for any one to trace and track their data as centralized authority of data ownership models.
- Composibility and reusablity; edit once update everywhere.
- Free from lock in of individual data which causes monopolies and little choice in other options.

Go in depth on each in the individual's gain.

#### What does Data Wallet mean for services

- Request users directly for their data
- More data and different kinds of data that was once harbored by centralized external possession of user data such as history and activities (truly p2p transactions)

Go in depth on each in the service's gain.

#### Now the technical implementation of these aforementioned solutions to our worldly problems and the promising result in features we'll see in web3

##### Preface

First and foremost, a truly secure and private data management system is required for the aforementioned features to flourish. (Note that I say truly because use and Facebook having access to data isn't completely private and secure). At the moment a large majority of our personal data like our activities (likes and dislikes) and history is hordered by large tech monopolies.
The kind of data you can request of tech companies is limited. Therefore, users must be in complete possession of their data.
The following things are what's happening under the hood to achieve the aforementioned goals of Data Wallet.

#### Privacy of data

Present the technical explanation of asymmetric private public encryption briefly.

#### Achieving difficulty in tracing and tracking data

For private data,
1. keep it encrypted somewhere where no one know who put it wherever you put it. It can be anywhere, as long as you don't give your personal information (more explaining in depth here I guess).

For public data, 
1. use refreshable reference keys to data, 
2. have a private pipeline (perhaps a private blockchain) through which services can ask for your reference keys, 
3. store the map of reference keys (who has what reference key so you can control who has what through the box & window model) encrypted somewhere where no one know who put it wherever you put it.

#### Composibility and reusability
