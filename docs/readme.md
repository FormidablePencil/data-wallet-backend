# Web3 paradigm shift

To understand what part does data wallets play in Web3, an overview of what Web3 will get you more context of the role data wallets play in. If you like to learn by example then feel free to skip to the data wallets whitepaper section.

<!-- We are moving into an era of truth and those who have been untruthful to one another fear, for they will be exposed. -->

### The abstract problems blockchain aims to solve

The blockchain won’t bring new features and shiny new things for people to indulge in like NFTs and crypto trading fads have taken blockchain to be. The blockchain simply is a technology to replace the underlying foundation upon which the current services of today are built on. So, our lifestyles won’t change with it we gain so much in the security of our privacy.

The paradigm the blockchain aims to support is the removing all hopeful trust to the powers that be and back to the hands of the individual.

The governments and large corporations of today are centralized powers of authority. You have to trust that whatever they are responsible for they will do right by you. With the instance of the government, you have to trust that your tax dollars are utilized properly, you have to trust that the dollar isn’t intentionally devalued by the deliberate printing of money. You have to trust that the information gathered by corporates and governments isn’t leaked, sold or used against you. That’s a lot of trust with little to no accountability. It baffles me that people think that username and password prevents others from accessing their personal information when the database where which all your data is stored is accessible to the higher ups in the companies. How could these people that hold that master keys to our data be held accountable when selling this data for personal profit only needs to be copied and pasted unlike tangible goods if it’s been stolen you would know. You can’t know who has what kind of data about you and thus is so dangerous to entrust the collection of your data to other people. After all, if they didn’t profit for it, they wouldn’t collect it. That’s why Facebook, instagram and YouTube is free to use. You are the product. The most troubling thing about giving your data to something is how they’ll use it. Look at Uber’s ‘god mode’ for example, with it it shows the location of all uber riders and customers. It sounds like it could be useful for good but with all power, it’s a double edged sword. It’s not the sword that inflicts evil until others, it’s the welder that swings it at those for his own personal good. Why would Facebook, YouTube, or the government care if they aren’t held accountable.

It’s been said that data is power in the form of the phrase ‘knowledge is power’, in other words if you know, you have the power to change and control whatever you know. That explains why we are so addicted to the products produced by the system. It pulls the strings behind the curtain.

### The blockchain solves two dilemmas

1. The control of money(link to video explaining) by creating a system where money cannot be minted by any one individual, there be a consensus for a change to happen, neither can it shut down even if it’s outlawed. The products of this intention is bitcoin and to some extent ethereum.
2. Truly secure data opposed to the current model of entrusting your data to others.

#### We’ll expound on the second point of the two dilemmas

Traditionally a central database was used to store data. Though you could have a mechanism to lock your data from others tempering with it, and restricting the sharing of it, the problem is that you couldn’t trust the code that would be that because it’s inaccessible to the user and would have to trust the companies by their words. So, this mechanism doesn’t exist. Furthermore, what prevents companies to persist your data even after you removed it through their user interface? You don’t have permission to view their logic that handles your data.

Note: It’s alright to have a concealed codebase but when people that work on it come and go and a lot of money and power comes into it then you don’t know who you’re entrusting. You just have to hope they follow the ideals they say to be.

The alternative is an immutable codebase which the blockchain gives an opportunity for. Ethereum is the leading blockchain and with already many layer 2 solutions built for scalability… Explain how ethereum achieves immutability and what it means in removing the middleman. 

#### ! (Explain here how blockchains like Ethereum achieve immutability and what it means in removing the middleman).

#### What it means to remove the middleman in the real world

1. No need for banks
2. No need for reliance on monopolies
3. Interaction directly between client and services
4. No need for enforcers of written contract agreements
5. ! (and more when I conjure them up)

! Explain these points in depth. The answer is blockchain makes code absolute.

Realistically, the reliance of the middleman won't be replaced abruptly. Its going to be a gradual change with the low hanging fruit is plucked first before more serious innovations disrupt the disrupters.

#### We are moving towards a world of autonomous laws which you'll be able to choose

We are moving towards an age of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), these are what are considered as dapps. To achieve sharing data without entrusting “authorities” to keep it secure, there must be a storage mechanism where only you have the ability to modify data and have it be decentralized. There are systems that already do that. IPFS for instance. The challenge is to have your data easily accessible by you, that’s why a lot of frontend needs to be developed, and not be tranced by any program to collect your data easily (only having the human manual work search by name and human collecting your data). The solution of creating this system where no service has access to your data firstly has to have the code be public and secondly the data must circulate in that environment without it copying your data or organizing it in a way that’s not necessary but to discriminate against you.

Ofcourse, there’s no way to prevent people from copying your data just as much as there’s no way to prevent people from taking a screenshot of your information or web scrapping for more sophisticated and automated copying online. However, the difference is that tracing your data will be a hard manual task to do and scaling to handling of tracing and storing a large mass of people’s data would be practically impossible. At the moment, a mass database of our information is stored already for our convenience of features like the kind that Facebook and Instagram provides but at the expense of already having the world’s private data at their finger tips. Another difference is that there would be no way of proving that the copied data is true and thus renders the seller of your data useless. Ultimately, it’s you sharing data and only you will be able to validate the authenticity of ownership through asymmetric encryption.

If you can validate it with a private key, then it’s yours. This will prevent others from making copies of your profile somewhere down the line. Having a system where your content that contains your image like videos and photos can validate the authenticity of the ownership of your content to give as a certificate of validation. Those accounts that fail to validate get removed from the autonomous system. This is Python, machine learning and AI. It has to be free from the hands of any one individual, other words, there can’t be any group of people pulling the strings even if it’s best that someone does because it defeats the purpose of a trustless system. (well, gives me a reason to learn machine learning, AI and lower level languages later down the road since a Facebook replica is what I’m building).

Now that the tangible real world and theoretical is out of the way, we’ll get technical with how these autonomous systems around our data will be built.

### Technical with how these autonomous systems around our data will be built 

## Q&A

#### Why spend time and resources to build another Facebook and YouTube?

Because people value privacy and wherever there’s potential value to bring to people there are venture capitalist and entrepreneurs, the pioneers of new ideas.

The technical side that needs to be built

#### Can it be stopped?

People have been wanting the alternative to the current ways that the world operates by. Try to outlaw it, suppress it, demonize it but nothing stops people from getting what they want. Eventually the dam of desire will bust open. The more people want it the stronger you have to build that damn. If you can’t beat them join them. Why go against the grain?

#### Why go through all the trouble of building this?

Why not, it’s fun, it’s right, it’s a loving thing to do. Unless you deem this world to mean nothing to you then get ready to be enlightened.
